          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm md:text-xl text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          I’m Aneeka, a B.Tech Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in DevOps, Cloud (AWS), Orchestration, and Linux systems. I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood — from containers to infrastructure automation — and applying that knowledge to build efficient, reliable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lately, I’ve been freelancing, successfully collaborating with clients to deliver accurate and effective results. I enjoy working on my own terms, which allows me to focus deeply and take ownership of the projects I handle.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm md:text-xl text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          Before transitioning into tech, I worked for several years as a freelance content writer, creating clear, engaging, and SEO-optimized content across various domains — an experience that strengthened my communication skills and attention to detail.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm md:text-xl text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          I’m currently focused on mastering infrastructure automation and scalable deployments, aiming to combine technical depth with problem-solving that delivers real business impact. I believe in learning by doing, and every project I take on reflects that mindset.        </p>
